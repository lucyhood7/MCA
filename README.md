# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

The theme chosen for this dataset is TV show theme songs.
Notated data for each of the songs is accessible through muse score community pages, where there are different arrangements and versions of each of the pieces which have been transcribed by other Musescore users. These can be downloaded in various different file formats including musescore format (.mscv), pdf, musicxml, midi and mp3. Other websites, such as ultimateguitar.com provide notated data in the form of lyrics, chords and guitar tablature. The versions on this website are not available to download and can only be accessed online.
Audio data can be found on YouTube as well streaming services such as Spotify and apple music. These platforms all have slightly different versions of the song, with different performers and different instrumental arrangements. They are also available to purchase and download on iTunes and other online music stores.
Descriptive data can be found when accessing the audio data and the notated data. This most commonly includes the title, composer, song length and performer name.
